# BAVI

Main module is VideoProcessor. Run that to detect targets and generate audio.  
You cant test the audio in AudioGenerator, but the video spawns that process if needed.
Biggest todos are:
* dynamic audio generation based on lidar distance reads. Read more abt this in AudioGenerator
* Make the audio sound less bad. Idk just try it out and you'll know. Might require rewrite or even total change of libraries we use.
